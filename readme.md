# Weather-Dashboard

## Purpose
Use the "OpenWeather API" to retrieve weather data for cities. When you search for a city, you are presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history, presented in a list. When you view current weather conditions for that city you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When you view the UV index, you are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.  When you view future weather conditions for that city, you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. When you click on a city in the search history, you are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
